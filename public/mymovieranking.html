<h1>The Best Movies According to Clark</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>
  This has to be my top 1, this movie is the culmination of the MCU <br />
  for the last 10 years. With all the story, action, emotion and in general
  <br />
  as a life-long marvel fan, the experience i felt inside that movie theatre
  <br />
  cannot be replicated in my lifetime.

<h3>2. Rise of the Plant of the Apes</h3>
<p>Cool Monkee Movie</p>
<h3>3. The 300</h3>
<p>This is Sparta!!!</p>
